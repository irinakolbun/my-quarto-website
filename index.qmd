Hello, I am Irina!

I am an undergraduate student that loves learning by doing. My main interests are mathematics and data analysis. I have some experience working as a data analyst for a product IT compamy in Ukraine.

I enjoy cooking and eating out with people. I believe that sharing food is an important and efficient way to socialize.
